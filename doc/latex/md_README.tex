This is a bunch of useful C modules. The name of this kind-\/of-\/library, \char`\"{}\-L\-I\-F\-T\char`\"{}, can be interpreted as a recursive acronym\-: Lift Is not a Framework or a Toolkit (a bunch of useful C modules).

Also, it is a slight pun on a well-\/known C++ library. This is C, we don't need a {\itshape boost} we just need a {\itshape lift}. \-:)

\subsection*{What is there}

Well, there is the \char`\"{}master\char`\"{} include file {\ttfamily \hyperlink{lift_8h}{lift.\-h}}, but, in most cases, you should just include the header of the module that you need.
