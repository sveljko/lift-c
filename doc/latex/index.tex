L\-I\-F\-T is a collectiong of useful C modules. It isn't a framework or a Toolkit. Most modules are either self-\/sufficient (depend only on parts of C standard library, or, in some cases, parts of standard library for a given system (P\-O\-S\-I\-X, Windows...)), or depend on a few other L\-I\-F\-T modules.

For a reasonably type-\/safe realloc for arrays (and, in most cases you use realloc for arrays), check out \hyperlink{lift__arealloc_8h}{lift\-\_\-arealloc.\-h}.

For a reasonably type-\/safe free that also N\-U\-L\-L-\/ifies the pointer, check out \hyperlink{lift__free__and__null_8h}{lift\-\_\-free\-\_\-and\-\_\-null.\-h}.

For a reasonably type-\/safe and efficient generic vector, with an interface inspired by C++ S\-T\-L, check out \hyperlink{lift__vec_8h}{lift\-\_\-vec.\-h}.

For a minimalistic, type-\/safe and efficient generic list, with interface having no resemblense of C++ S\-T\-L, check out \hyperlink{lift__list_8h}{lift\-\_\-list.\-h}.
