# lift-c

This is a bunch of useful C modules. The name of this kind-of-library,
"LIFT", can be interpreted as a recursive acronym:
Lift Is not a Framework or a Toolkit (a bunch of useful C modules).

Also, it is a slight pun on a well-known C++ library. This is C,
we don't need a _boost_ we just need a _lift_. :)


## What is there

Well, there is the "master" include file `lift.h`, but, in most
cases, you should just include the header of the module that
you need.

The documentation should be visible here [Doxygen generated documentation](doc/html/index.html).
