/** @mainpage LIFT

    LIFT is a collectiong of useful C modules.
    It isn't a framework or a Toolkit. Most modules
    are either self-sufficient (other than parts of
    C standard librarry, or, in some cases, parts of
    library for a given system (POSIX, Windows...),
    or depend on few other LIFT modules.
